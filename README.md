# Kind Feedback Form

Build a clean, modern customer support feedback form as a single page.




The form should have:

- A heading "Customer Support" with a short friendly subtitle

- A text field: "Your Name"

- An email field: "Your Email"

- A larger text area: "How can we help? Describe your issue or feedback"

- A "Submit" button




When the user clicks Submit:

- Send the form data as a JSON POST request to a webhook.

- Read the webhook URL from a secret named N8N_WEBHOOK_URL. Do NOT hardcode it.

- The JSON body must use exactly these keys: customerName, customerEmail, feedback

- Show a loading state, then on success show a thank-you message.




No backend or database is needed. Keep it friendly with soft colours and rounded corners.
